//! The typed word is matched against every dictionary word by a weighted
//! edit distance computed down the trie, one row per dictionary character,
//! so a branch is dropped as soon as no word below it can come close
//! enough. Case and accents cost nothing: the keyboard types neither
//! umlauts nor accents directly, so "uber" has to find "über" and "strasse"
//! has to find "Straße". Words that start with what was typed are offered
//! as completions. Candidates are ranked by frequency against cost, with the
//! frequency taken from the previous word's next-word list where it has one.
